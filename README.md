# Magisk Call Recorder for Huawei devices

Credits to Blackball for the Call Recorder zip, I (Atarii) just wrapped it inside a Magisk module
Original zip: https://forum.xda-developers.com/p10-plus/themes/mod-huawei-callrecorder-t3614470

This makes an icon available on the call screen to record calls. Recordings are saved to /sdcard/record (or external SD Card if available), with filename contact@number_date.amr

Tested with Huawei P9 (b386) EMUI 5.0
